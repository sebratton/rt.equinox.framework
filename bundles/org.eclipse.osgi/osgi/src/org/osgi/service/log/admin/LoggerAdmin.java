/**
 * LoggerAdmin service for configuring loggers.
 * <p>
 * Each bundle may have its own named {@link LoggerContext} based upon its
 * bundle symbolic name, bundle version, and bundle location. There is also a
 * root Logger Context from which each named Logger Context inherits. The root
 * Logger Context has no name.
 * <p>
 * When a bundle logs, the logger implementation must locate the Logger Context
 * for the bundle to determine the
 * {@link LoggerContext#getEffectiveLogLevel(String) effective log level} of the
 * logger name. The <i>best matching name</i> for the Logger Context is the
 * longest name, which has a non-empty Logger Context, according to this syntax:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * name ::= symbolic-name ( ’|’ version ( ’|’ location )? )?
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The version must be formatted canonically, that is, according to the
 * {@code toString()} method of the {@code Version} class. So the Logger Context
 * for a bundle is searched for using the following names in the given order:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;symbolic-name&gt;|&lt;version&gt;|&lt;location&gt;
 * &lt;symbolic-name&gt;|&lt;version&gt;
 * &lt;symbolic-name&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If a non-empty Logger Context is not found, the Logger Context with the name
 * {@code <symbolic-name>} is used for the bundle.
