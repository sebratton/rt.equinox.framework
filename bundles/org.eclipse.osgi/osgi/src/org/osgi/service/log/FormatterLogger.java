/**
 * Provides methods for bundles to write messages to the log using printf-style
 * format strings.
 * <p>
 * Messages can be formatted by the Logger once the Logger determines the log
 * level is enabled. Uses printf-style format strings as described in
 * {@link java.util.Formatter}.
 * <p>
 * You can also add a {@code Throwable} and/or {@code ServiceReference} to the
 * generated {@link LogEntry} by passing them to the logging methods as
 * additional arguments. If the last argument is a {@code Throwable} or
 * {@code ServiceReference}, it is added to the generated {@link LogEntry} and
 * then if the next to last argument is a {@code ServiceReference} or
 * {@code Throwable} and not the same type as the last argument, it is added to
 * the generated {@link LogEntry}. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * logger.info("Found service %s.", serviceReference, serviceReference);
 * logger.warn("Something named %s happened.", name, serviceReference,
 * 		throwable);
 * logger.error("Failed.", exception);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If an exception occurs formatting the message, the logged message will
 * indicate the formatting failure including the format string and the
 * arguments.
